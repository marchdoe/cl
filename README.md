<!-- ## Overview
This component lib is set up to use [styled-components]("") and [polished](https://github.com/styled-components/polished) ðŸ’…. This is a starter for you to create your own components and easily publish them to npm.

### File Structure

Add in atomic design principles here

## Local Development

### Tests
_**NOTE:** As there are no components added by default, there are no tests. But the infrastructure is set up for you to run your tests. This app is setup to use Mocha, Enzyme, and Expect. The `test` script is looking for test files with a `.spec.js` extension, e.g. MyComponent.spec.js._
Run once:
```
$ npm test
```

Run the watch script:
```
$ npm run test:watch
```

### Build
_**NOTE:** When you run `build`, Babel will create a `build` directory. This is what your users will interact with when they use your library. Nothing in `lib` gets shipped with your published module._

Run once:
```
$ npm run build
```

Run the watch script:
```
$ npm run build:watch
```

_**NOTE:** the build script runs in the `prepublish` script just before you publish to npm._

## Publishing
If you already have an account with npm, you can simply run:
```
$ npm login
$ npm publish
```

If you don't have an account with npm:

_**NOTE:** Your email address is public_
```
$ npm set init.author.name "Your Name"
$ npm set init.author.email "you@example.com"
$ npm set init.author.url "http://yourblog.com"
$ npm adduser
$ npm publish
```
